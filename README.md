# React

My go-to repo for React projects with serverside rendering. Easy to create templates / styles.

Simply clone this repo type ```yarn install``` to install all the modules. Once it's finished start building the project with ```yarn watch```. This will create a server running on ```localhost:1337```

I chose to use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styling. There are a few exammples in the ```/src/app/styles/``` directory. Mediaqueries have been created.
